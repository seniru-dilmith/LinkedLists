# C++ LinkedList

This repository contains an implementation of a LinkedList data structure in C++. LinkedList is a fundamental data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence.

## Overview

A LinkedList is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (node) contains a data field and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This implementation provides basic operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search on the LinkedList.

## Files

- `LinkedList.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the LinkedList data structure with methods for insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the repository.

## Usage

To use the LinkedList data structure in your project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Include the `LinkedList.cpp` file in your project.
3. Create a `LinkedList` object and use its methods to perform operations on the list.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "LinkedList.cpp" // Include the LinkedList implementation file

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Example usage of LinkedList
    LinkedList list;

    // Insert elements into the LinkedList
    list.insertAtEnd(10);
    list.insertAtEnd(20);
    list.insertAtEnd(30);

    // Print the LinkedList
    cout << "LinkedList: ";
    list.display();

    // Search for an element
    int key = 20;
    if (list.search(key))
        cout << key << " found in the LinkedList." << endl;
    else
        cout << key << " not found in the LinkedList." << endl;

    // Delete an element
    list.deleteNode(20);
    cout << "After deleting " << key << ": ";
    list.display();

    return 0;
}
```
